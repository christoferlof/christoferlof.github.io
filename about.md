This is my blog where I write about just anything that I may come across in my job as Product Manager at Flightradar24 or while building something or while riding my mountain bike.

In addition to the posts in this blog, I've contributed to a couple of public projects on my spare time such as the [ALM Rangers Test Guidance](http://vsartesttoolingguide.codeplex.com/), [*CodedUI CodeFirst*](http://codeduicodefirst.codeplex.com/), a [book on Scrum with Visual Studio]({% post_url 2012-12-16-book-contributor %}) and [apps for Flightradar24](http://windowsphone.com/s?appId=6341514f-ad9d-43de-a579-34086c4180e7). 

Before joining Flightradar24 full-time, I worked as a Solution Architect at Microsoft, building lots of fancy cloud solutions.

I'm always open for a coffee and to talk about Product Mananagement, DevOps, Cloud Architecture, Aviation and Mountainbiking.
