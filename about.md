This is my blog where I write about just anything that I may come across in my job as a Solution Architect at Microsoft or while building on any of my apps or while riding my bike.

In addition to the posts in this blog I've contributed to a couple of public projects on my spare time such as the [ALM Rangers Test Guidance](http://vsartesttoolingguide.codeplex.com/), [*CodedUI CodeFirst*](http://codeduicodefirst.codeplex.com/), a [book on Scrum with Visual Studio]({% post_url 2012-12-16-book-contributor %}) and [apps for Flightradar24](http://windowsphone.com/s?appId=6341514f-ad9d-43de-a579-34086c4180e7).
